It's characterized by a good structure, active microbial life, and high organic matter content, allowing for efficient water and nutrient cycling. Healthy soil also minimizes soil erosion and compaction, and reduces the need for external inputs like synthetic fertilizers. </strong></p>

            <p id="para-2"><strong>Soil erosion is the process where topsoil, the most fertile layer of soil, is detached and moved from one location to another by agents like water, wind, or ice. It's a natural process but can be significantly accelerated by human activities such as intensive agriculture, deforestation, and overgrazing. Soil erosion leads to land degradation, impacting agricultural productivity, water quality, and overall ecosystem health. </strong></p>
